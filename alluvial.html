            <h1>Alluvial Soil</h1>
				<p> Alluvial soil has the highest productivity with respect to other soils. It is present mostly along rivers and is carried by its streams during weathering of rocks. The soil is generally covered by tall grasses and forests, as well as a number of crops, such as rice, wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, maize, cotton, soybean, jute, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, etc. This soil has very soft strata with the lowest proportion of nitrogen and humus but with an adequate amount of phosphate. There is a wide variation in the amount of iron oxide and lime in different regions. Alluvial soil is one of the best soils, requiring the least water due to its high porosity. The consistency of alluvial soil ranges from drift sand and rich, loamy soil to silt clays. India is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of alluvial soil, which covers more than 46% of its total land area. Most alluvial soils are derived from the sediment being deposited by the river Ganga in the Indo–Gangetic plain, ranging from Punjab in the west to West Bengal and Assam in the east, as well as in the coastal areas of northern parts of Gujarat, Narmada, and Tapi valleys, which are formed by sea waves. The alluvial soil found in India, particularly in the Indo–Gangetic plain, is of two types: khaddar (pale brown, sandy clays to loamy, less calcareous and carbonaceous soil, and found in the low areas of valley that are regularly flooded) and older bhangar soils (dark colored, mostly clayey, and containing lime nodules) </p>
	<p> Maize grows well in Bangladesh’s fertile alluvial soils and yields there are among the highest in the region. The crop is sown at the start of the cool Rabi season, which runs from November to April, after the harvesting of the rice crop grown during the July–December Aman monsoon season. While Rabi maize is generally cultivated as the sole crop, many farmers have begun to intercrop it with potatoes and with early maturing vegetables, such as red amaranth, spinach, radish, coriander, and French beans. Peas are also intercropped with maize because they do not compete for sunlight, nutrients, or space (Ali et al., 2009). </p>
<h2>  Rice, wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, jute, maize, oilseeds, vegetables are suitable crops for this soil.  </h2>
