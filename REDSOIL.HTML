            <h1>Red Soil</h1>
		
<p> Red soil is a type of soil that develops in a warm, temperate, moist climate under deciduous or mixed forest, having thin organic and organic-mineral layers overlying a yellowish-brown leached layer resting on an illuvium red layer. Red soils are generally derived from crystalline rock. They are usually poor growing soils, low in nutrients and humus and difficult to be cultivated because of its low water holding capacity. 
Red soils are an important resource. </p>
<p> Red soils denote the third largest soil group of India covering an area of about 3.5 lakhs sq. km (10.6% of India's area) over the Peninsula from Tamil Nadu in the south to Bundelkhand in the north and Rajmahal hills in the east to Katchch in the west. They surround the red soils on their south, east and north.[3] It looks yellow in its hydrated form.  </p>
<p> This soil in India, also known as the omnibus group, have been developed over Archaean granite, gneiss and other crystalline rocks, the sedimentaries of the Cuddapah and Vindhayan basins and mixed Dharwarian group of rocks. Their colour is mainly due to ferric oxides occurring as thin coatings on the soil particles while the iron oxide occurs as haematite or as hydrous ferric oxide, the color is red and when it occurs in the hydrate form as limonite the soil gets a yellow colour. Ordinarily the surface soils are red while the horizon below gets yellowish colour.  </p>          
<br><br><p><h3> MC(%) on dry weight basin=100 * (weight of groundnut sample with container before drying -weight of groundnut sample with container afterdrying)/ (weight of groundnut sample with container afterdrying- weight of container).</h2></p></br></br>
  <p> Percentage of soil moisture present = (data/225)*100
 <br> soil = 100 - soil</p>
  <h2>  Red gram, Bengal gram, green gram, groundnut and castor seed are the crops that can be grown in this soil. </h2>
