            <h1>Clay Soil</h1>
		
<p> Soil Type of Mountains are mainly found in hill slopes and are formed by deposition of organic matter from woodlands and forests. Mountain soils are generally located in the dry and cold districts like Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti District, Kinnaur District etc.</p>
<p> The basic character of the mountain soils depend on the climate and are mainly found in the warm temperate belt or the cool temperate belt of the Himalaya Mountains.

Brown forest soil is mainly found in the warm temperate belt lying at heights ranging from 900 to 1800 metres, which has deciduous forests.
		  <p> Mountain soils embrace peat, meadow, forest and soils. The forest soils can be described as soils in the making. Owing to the extensive variety of fertile soil, India is able to turn out a variety of crops. It is important because this potential can make India not only self – reliant in agricultural produce, but also a leading exporter of countless agricultural products.</p>
		  <p> This would, however depend on scientific management of the soil, their right conservation, evasion of their erosion and upkeep of their fertility through bio – manures, rather than depending wholly on chemical fertilisers.

This is obvious from the fact that almost nine million hectares of alluvial soil and seven million hectares of black soil are presently suffering from salinity and alkalinity.

<h2> Peas, beans, corn, squash, pumpkin, watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumbers, carrots, beets, chard, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, various herbs, cabbages, cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, kale are the crops suitable to grow in this soil.  </h2>
